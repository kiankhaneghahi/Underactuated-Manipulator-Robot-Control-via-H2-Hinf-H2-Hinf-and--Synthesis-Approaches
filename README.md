# Underactuated Manipulator Robot Control via H2, H∞, H2/H∞, and μ-Synthesis Approaches: a Comparative Study

This project is a simple simulation of the below journal in MATLAB with the same name as the project. This project was done as the final project of
the Robust Control university course.

Siqueira, A.A.G. & Terra, M.H. & Ishihara, Joao & Barbeiro, Tacio. (2009). Underactuated Manipulator Robot Control via H-2, H-infinity,
H-2/H-infinity, and mu-Synthesis Approaches: a Comparative Study. Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering. 31. 279-288.

For more info on the project visit the presentation pdf file. Note that, as it is obvious in the presentation, the hinf synthesis was used 
instead of h2 synthesis by mistake at the time of the handing out the project but a simple modification to the code should solve it (The uploaded code has been corrected). Also, for simplification, not all of the journal was simulated.
