# Underactuated Manipulator Robot Control via H2, H∞, H2/H∞, and μ-Synthesis Approaches: a Comparative Study

This project is a simple simulation of the below journal in MATLAB with the same name as the project. This project was done as the final project of the Robust Control university course.

Siqueira, A.A.G. & Terra, M.H. & Ishihara, Joao & Barbeiro, Tacio. (2009). Underactuated Manipulator Robot Control via H-2, H-infinity,H-2/H-infinity, and mu-Synthesis Approaches: a Comparative Study. Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering. 31. 279-288.

The Robot used in this project is UArm II which is a planar 3DOF manipulator. The types of robust control methods used are Hinf, H2, H2Hinf combination and Mu-synthesis. In order to achieve these methods, first the MK standard form should be formed and for the Mu-synthesis, a multiplicative uncertainty should be  placed in the input of the plant with weighing function W_delta.

For more info on the project visit the presentation pdf file. Note that, as it is obvious in the presentation, the hinf synthesis was used instead of h2 synthesis by mistake at the time of the handing out the project but a simple modification to the code should solve it (The uploaded code has been corrected). Also, for simplification, not all of the journal was simulated.
